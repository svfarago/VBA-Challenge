== Random Notes ===============
This is my first official attempt at VBA. I chewed through a lot of bubblegum trying to figure this code out, and more importantly got the help from a lot of people. #ClassmatesRule
Code is likely very messy and could be refined by an experienced VBA programmer.
Please see rem/comments throughout the VBA file for additional notes or references.
